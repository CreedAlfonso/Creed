# Creed S. Alfonso 

I am a driven, focused, and determined individual who is always willing to go the extra
mile or two to make sure that I'm meeting my goals. I am also very honest, which leads
me to be a trustworthy person, which allows me to be a great role model for other
people.
I have a strong work ethic and love to learn new things every day because of how
productive it makes me feel. My goal is to grow by learning new skills and becoming
even more confident in my abilities as well as my ability to help others grow.
To grow as a leader and a student, I believe that I need to continue working on my
communication skills so that I can be better to connect with others at work as well as
with other people outside of school. I also want to continue developing leadership skills
so that when opportunities present themselves, I'll be ready for them!
Finally, one of my ambitions is to become part of a team or an industry where we all
work together towards achieving the same goals â€” something that's difficult for some
businesses today but seems so simple when you really think about it!
